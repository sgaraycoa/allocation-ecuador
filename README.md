# allocation-ecuador

This is a ShinyApp that shows the results of the 2017 legislative elections in Ecuador and, specifically, plots the effect of the allocation method (D'Hondt or Webster). These two methods of allocation are used to determine how many seats each party win within multi-member districts and are the most common worldwide. Ecuador switched from a Webster system to a D'Hondt system between the 2009 and 2013 legislative elections. The data shows that the electoral outcomes of this change appear small at a district level but on aggregate at the national level can have significant effects. One particular observation of interest is that one party gains an additional 10% of total seats which is both substantively significant  in general and even more considering that it meant the difference between a plurality and a majority of legislative seats. Moreover, this party (Alianza Pais) was the one largely in control of the executive and legislative branches in 2012 when the national assembly voted in favor of a number of electoral reforms including the change from Webster to D'Hondt.


Future steps: add in the results of 2009 and 2013 for comparison and improve visualization. Include measures of electoral competition and concentration.
